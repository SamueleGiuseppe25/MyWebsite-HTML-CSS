        <p id="p-woodland">
            We currently own and manage a network of native woodland across Ireland, covering every province and incorporating a mosaic of other habitats, including rivers and other wetlands.
            
        </p>
        <p id="p-woodland">
            All of our sites are generally open to the public and accessible to visitors. They are also often strategically placed – adjacent to public greenways or protected areas,
             such as Special Areas of Conservation and National Parks.
        </p>
        <p id="p-woodland">
            Several of our woods are also some of the rarest types – ancient woodlands which have descended from the original primeval forests that once blanketed all of Ireland. These woodlands are the last refuges
             of many species and are now reduced to as little as 0.1% of their original extent.
